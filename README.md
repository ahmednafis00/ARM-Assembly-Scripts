# ARM-Assembly-Scripts

This repository contains few of the programs I developed while learning to code in Assembly language. Each program's functionalities have been commented at the top of their respective scripts. 

Please use ARM Simulator (needs Windows emulator on MacOS) to run any of these programs.
